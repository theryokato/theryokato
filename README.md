I'm a mechanical engineer with a passion for robotics and space engineering. I hope as an engineer, I can help bring space closer to our everyday lives and enrich it as a whole. I work on both mechanical design and control systems. ðŸ¤–

Outside of engineering, Iâ€™m enjoy photography and making digital art ðŸŽ¨
